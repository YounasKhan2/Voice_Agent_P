# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for redesigning the chat interface to match the modern, polished design generated by Stitch. The redesign will transform the current basic chat interface into a professional, dark-mode-enabled conversational UI with a sidebar for chat history, improved message display, and enhanced user experience.

## Glossary

- **Chat_Interface**: The main conversational UI where users interact with the AI voice agent
- **Sidebar**: The left navigation panel containing chat history and user controls
- **Message_Bubble**: Individual chat message containers with sender identification
- **Quick_Actions**: Suggested action buttons displayed above the input field
- **Chat_History**: List of previous conversations accessible from the sidebar
- **Dark_Mode**: Color scheme optimized for low-light viewing with dark backgrounds
